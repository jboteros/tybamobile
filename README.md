Tyba Food Places, Johnatan Botero Developer Test

===

This is a technical test on React Native developed by Johnatan Botero

## Setup

Install the complementary packages

```
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

Run the project

```
react-native run-ios
# or
react-native run-Android
```

## Available Scripts

If Yarn was installed when the project was initialized, then dependencies will have been installed via Yarn, and you should probably use it to run these commands as well. Unlike dependency installation, command running syntax is identical for Yarn and NPM at the time of this writing.

```
yarn ios
#or
yarn android
```

If use npm

```
npm run ios

#or
npm run android
```
